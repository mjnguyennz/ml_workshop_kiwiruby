# Machine Learning for Developers

### Presented by Mai Nguyen
### KiwiRuby in Wellington, New Zealand, November 2, 2017

## Introduction
In this 3 hour workshop you will learn about the Machine Learning workflow, and how to apply machine learning techniques in Ruby. While the theory of machine learning concepts is necessary, nothing beats actually diving in and giving it a try. Hopefully, after this workshop, you will be inspired to continue with Machine Learning and to contribute to the Ruby community and help improve the ecosystem of tools available in Ruby for Machine Learning and Data Science. This workshop does not require too much knowledge of math and statistics, but certainly a familiarity with basic statistics will help.

## Slides
The slides for this workshop are available at Speakerdeck, as well as here in this repository.

## The Plan
In this workshop you can explore the options most interesting to you. We will look at a MLaaS (Machine Learning as a Service) BigML. We will also discuss leveraging Python's data science tools and library from within Ruby, as well as touch on some Machine Learning tools that have been ported to Ruby.

The general format of the workshop is as follows:

60 minutes - Lecture about the Machine Learning and the basic workflow.
