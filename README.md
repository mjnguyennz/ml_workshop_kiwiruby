# Machine Learning for (Ruby) Developers

### Presented by Mai Nguyen
### KiwiRuby in Wellington, New Zealand, November 2, 2017

## Introduction
In this 3 hour workshop you will learn about the Machine Learning workflow, and how to apply machine learning techniques in Ruby. While the theory of machine learning concepts is necessary, nothing beats actually diving in and giving it a try. Hopefully, after this workshop, you will be inspired to continue with Machine Learning and to contribute to the Ruby community and help improve the ecosystem of [tools available](ML_with_Ruby.md) in Ruby for Machine Learning and Data Science. This workshop does not require too much knowledge of math and statistics, but certainly a familiarity with basic statistics will help.

## Slides
The slides for this workshop are available at Speakerdeck, as well as [here](slides.pdf) in this repository.

## Outline
In this workshop, I have tried to keep the exercises as flexible as possible, so you can explore the machine learning aspects most interesting to you. In addition to learning about general Machine Learning concepts, we will apply them as we explore a MLaaS (Machine Learning as a Service) and leveraging Python's data science tools and libraries from within Ruby, as well as touch on some Machine Learning tools that have been ported to Ruby.

The general format of the workshop is as follows:

40 minutes - Lecture about the Machine Learning and the basic workflow and data preparation. [Slides](slides.pdf)

20 minutes - Exploring data with some quick thought exercises. [Data exercises](Data_Exercises.md)

15 minutes - Evaluating models. [Slides](slides.pdf)

30 minutes - Tea Break

45 minutes - BigML demonstration, and try it for yourself! [Quickstart Guide](ML_with_BigML.md)

50 minutes - PyCall examples, and try it out! [Get started](ML_with_PyCall.md)

10 minutes - Wrap up.
