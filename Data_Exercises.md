# Data Exercises

## Introduction
Data is so important in Machine Learning. Practitioners will spend around 80% of their time on data preparation. Determining what data to collect, data collection, ensuring the data is usable, and getting the data ML-ready all have their challenges.

We will explore some of these issues while examining a number of datasets.
