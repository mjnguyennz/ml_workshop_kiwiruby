# Machine Learning Tools in Ruby

The data science and data visualisation tools available in Ruby are not complete compared to Python. Fortunately, the toolset is growing and improving with time. You may find the algorithms and tools you need already available. See the links below to see what's available. If this workshop inspires you to continue with Machine Learning, consider getting involved and contributing to our Ruby machine learning ecosystem!
